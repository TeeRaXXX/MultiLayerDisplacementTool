# MultiLayerDisplacementTool

The Multi Layer Displacement Tool (MLD) is a sophisticated Blender addon for creating complex displacement effects by blending multiple material layers with mask-based control. It uses a "HeightFill" algorithm to intelligently blend displacement maps from different materials based on painted vertex color masks.
